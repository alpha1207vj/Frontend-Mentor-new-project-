This code represents the structure and styling of a profile card for a social media presence, designed to be sleek and visually appealing. The HTML defines a profile container, including a profile image, personal text information, and a series of social media buttons. The CSS controls the layout, colors, typography, and spacing to create a minimal and clean design with a dark theme. The most challenging part of the project was positioning the social media buttons correctly. Initially, the buttons were meant to be grouped together in a single container. However, since the social media links were placed inside three separate inner divs, I had to manually adjust their positioning. To achieve this, I used `position: absolute` for each button, giving me precise control over their placement relative to their parent container. This method allowed me to break free from the natural flow of the page layout, making it easier to position the buttons in a vertical stack while still keeping everything within the confines of the profile card.
